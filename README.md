# TastyRecipes

  A person can search for recipes by entering ingredients, a course, or a type of meal they want.  This gem will pull all recipe titles from Tasty (tasty.co) matching their search and a person can choose which recipe they'd like to try.  Once the person inputs which recipe, all the required ingredients and instructions will display.

  If a person inputs an invalid search, the program will notify them and restart.  If they input an invalid response from the listed recipes, they will be notified and start a new search.
